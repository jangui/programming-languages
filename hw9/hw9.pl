Question 1

E is true if C and D are True.
C is true if A and B are True.
A and B are both true because they are each facts.
Therefore C is true.
D is true becaues it is a fact.
Therefor E is true.

E is also true if G is True.
But G's truth depends on F which we known nothing about

Regardless, E was already made true from the first horn clause.

Question 2
